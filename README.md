# Matlab-Code-Beautifier
An enhanced matlab code beautifier with more features than the standard matlab auto-indenter. 

# Why
For other languages like C/C++/Java etc. code beautifiers exist that make the code formatting nicer to view. Auto-indent, equal sign alignment, empty line removal etc. improve the readability and maintainability and reduce the propability of bugs. 

# What
At first a command line tool shall be developed that does this features so it can be used for git hooks and with scripts. 

Second a UI shall allow normal users to beautify matlab code without CLI knowledge.
